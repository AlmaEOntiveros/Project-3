**Overview**   
This project aims to analyze stock market data to see how the top 5 US and International tech stocks performed in Trump and Biden's first year in office, 2017 and 2021, respectively.  

This data was analyzed using:  
Jupyter Notebook  
MongoDB  
  

Libraries include: 
Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, YFinance, Flask, Dash

**Ethical considerations made in the project:**  
For this project, we addressed the potential for bias by analyzing stock changes for two recent Presidents. One Republican, one Democrat. We also broadened our stock analysis to analyze tech companies in the US as well as abroad. We added another element of scope by considering diversity in tech to consider how it affects changes in the stock market.  
We have provided our resources for the data here and confirm that it has not been altered. All analyses represent the data as it is.
