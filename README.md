**Ethical Considerations**

To minimize bias, we:
- Examined stock market performance under both a Republican and a Democratic president.
- Included both U.S. and international tech companies for a broader perspective.
- Incorporated diversity in tech as an additional factor to explore its impact on stock performance.

We ensured transparency by sourcing publicly available data and keeping analyses true to the original datasets without modifications.
